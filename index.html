        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visited in dec 2018</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the
          entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says
          thvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The
          food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a
          trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On
          other days, the crowd there is pretty hep &
          happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i had visited in jan 2018</h5>
        <p class="text-muted">Between 1724 and 1730 Maharajah Sawaii Jai Singh II of Jaipur constructed five
          astronomical observatories in northern India. The observatories, or "Jantar Mantars" as they are commonly
          known, incorporate multiple buildings of unique form, each with a specialized function for astronomical
          measurement. These structures with their striking combinations of geometric forms at large scale have
          captivated the attention of architects, artists, and art historians world wide, yet remain largely unknown to
          the general public. Explore the observatories by reading more about them in the Learn section, taking a
          virtual Tour, or visiting the Gallery.</p>

        <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the
          story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of
          ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the
          other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler
          alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed sci-fi
          series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore
          balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

        <p>I took my kids to watch the movie and they loved it. The story shows how a young lion prince, after the murder of his father, flees his kingdom only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery. This movie is worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and cinematography. The music was phenomenal. Beyonc√© really brought Nala to live but the show stealers were Timon and Pumba. Kids would love it.</p>
